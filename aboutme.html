      <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Travel
          <p>This is my first attempt studying abroad so I enjoy traveling during the holidays and visiting new places. I have plans to visit all the states in the US before I graduate but it is now looking kind of unlikely.</p>

        <li>Dota 2 & Fifa
          <p>Aside from traveling, I play a lot of video games in my free time but most of my gaming-hours contribute toward Dota 2 and Fifa 23</p>

        <li>Education & Career Paths
          <p>Although I've chosen CS as my major, I am very much interested in either Front-end or Full-stack rather than Back-end and I am looking towards working with Web Development</p>
